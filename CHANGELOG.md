## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-20

### 🎉 First Stable Release

Production-ready LED control for Klipper printers. Tested on Voron Trident with full state cycle validation (fresh install → heating → printing → cooldown → idle → bored → sleep → rewake cycle).

### Added

#### Core Features
- Real-time state detection for 7 printer states: idle, heating, printing, cooldown, error, bored, sleep
- GPIO driver with ws281x-proxy (60fps smooth animations, bypasses G-code queue)
- Klipper driver (SET_LED for MCU-attached LEDs)
- PWM driver (SET_PIN for non-addressable LED strips)
- 5 LED effects: solid, pulse, heartbeat, disco, thermal gradient, print progress bar
- 50+ named colors (Aurora-compatible palette)
- Hot reload via `/server/lumen/reload` API endpoint
- Config validation with helpful warnings
- Debug logging to journalctl and Mainsail console
- Interactive installer with automatic path detection
- Thread-safe ws281x proxy with proper locking
- Shutdown cleanup handler (gracefully turns off LEDs on exit)
- Motion report subscription for immediate position tracking

#### Installation & Maintenance
- Automated installer (`install.sh`) with interactive prompts
- Automated uninstaller (`uninstall.sh`) with complete cleanup
- Automatic moonraker.conf section management (install/uninstall)
- Debug mode comments in installer for user guidance

### Fixed

#### Critical Bugs (December 19-20, 2025)
- **Config parser bug**: Fixed missing gpio_pin, proxy_host, proxy_port, color_order storage in LED group config
- **Effect state race condition**: Apply immediate effects before updating state to prevent animation loop conflicts
- **Install script path**: Fixed ws281x-proxy path reference (was pointing to outdated location)
- **Race condition in ws281x_proxy.py**: Added global `_strip_locks_lock` for thread-safe lock initialization

#### Driver Improvements
- GPIO driver now properly handles strip expansion (recreates PixelStrip with existing LED states)
- ProxyDriver async initialization cleaned up (removed broken code)
- KlipperDriver INDEX loop logic verified and documented

#### Logging & Debugging
- Debug logging now properly respects False/True/console modes
- Thermal effect logging throttled (only logs on temp change ≥1°C or every 10s)
- Added color_order validation with helpful warnings

#### Configuration & Setup
- Motion_report now included in initial query (position available immediately)
- Verified gpio_fps setting is actively used by animation loop
- Enhanced uninstaller to automatically remove moonraker.conf sections (creates backup)
- Enhanced uninstaller to optionally remove ~/lumen directory

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md with installation, configuration, and troubleshooting
- TODO.md roadmap with future feature planning
- Example configuration in `config/lumen.cfg.example`
- GPIO 19 audio conflict troubleshooting documented
- Production status badges and testing notes

## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - What's Working

**Tested Hardware:**
- Voron Trident with Raspberry Pi 4
- WS2812B LED strips on GPIO 21
- Full state cycle validation complete

**Performance:**
- 60fps smooth animations on GPIO driver
- <1% CPU usage on Raspberry Pi 4
- ~50MB memory footprint

**Known Limitations:**
- Klipper driver slower during prints (G-code queue bottleneck) - expected behavior
- GPIO 19 conflicts with audio on Raspberry Pi (use GPIO 18 instead)

**Upgrade Path:**
- v1.1.0 will add: paused, homing, meshing, leveling, probing states
- v1.2.0 will add: rainbow, fire, comet, chase, alert, wipe effects
- v1.3.0 will add: chamber temp, filament sensors, Z-height gradients
