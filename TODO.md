## ✅ v1.2.0 - Additional Printer States (December 2025)

### New States to Detect
- [x] **Homing** - G28 in progress
- [x] **Meshing** - BED_MESH_CALIBRATE running
- [x] **Leveling** - QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL or Z_TILT_ADJUST running
- [x] **Probing** - PROBE_CALIBRATE or similar
- [x] **Paused** - Print paused by user or PAUSE macro
- [x] **Cancelled** - Print cancelled by CANCEL_PRINT macro
- [x] **Filament Change** - Filament load/unload/runout (M600, etc.)

**Implementation Approach:**
- User-configurable macro tracking in `[lumen_settings]`
  ```ini
  macro_homing: G28
  macro_meshing: BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
  macro_leveling: QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL, Z_TILT_ADJUST
  macro_probing: PROBE_CALIBRATE
  macro_paused: PAUSE
  macro_cancelled: CANCEL_PRINT
  macro_filament: M600, FILAMENT_RUNOUT, LOAD_FILAMENT, UNLOAD_FILAMENT
  ```
- Subscribe to `notify_gcode_response` via Moonraker websocket
- Parse G-code responses for configured macro names
- Set appropriate state when macro detected
- Return to normal state cycle when macro completes

**Benefits:**
- Universal compatibility with any printer's custom macros
- User has full control over which macros trigger which states
- No need to hardcode macro names or maintain compatibility lists
- Simple implementation using existing Moonraker infrastructure

## ⚡ v1.4.4 - Effect-Aware Adaptive FPS (December 2025)

### Performance Improvements ✅
- [x] **Effect-aware FPS scaling** - Intelligent update rates based on effect complexity
  - Static effects (solid, off): 5 FPS maximum - no animation needed

- [x] **Optimized HTTP request distribution** - Reduces unnecessary updates for static/slow effects
- [x] **CPU/bandwidth conservation** - Frees resources for fast animations

### Results
- v1.4.3: 28-38 FPS achieved (HTTP bottleneck at 180 req/s with 3 proxy groups)
- v1.4.4: Adaptive scaling reduces request load, allows fast effects to reach higher FPS
- Smart resource allocation: static effects don't waste updates, fast effects get priority

## 🔧 v1.5.0 - Quality of Life

### Configuration Enhancements
- [ ] **Group Min/Max brightness** - Allow group based min/max brightness
### API Improvements
- [ ] **GET /server/lumen/effects** - List all available effects and parameters
- [ ] **POST /server/lumen/set_group** - Temporarily override group effect via API
- [ ] **WebSocket notifications** - Broadcast state changes to Mainsail/Fluidd
- [ ] **Macro integration** - LUMEN_SET_RELOAD reload lumen after a .cfg change


### Debugging Tools
- [ ] **Effect/state testing mode** - Test effects/states using simple macros. Macro to start testing, macros to change to next state or back a state, macros to change to next effect or back an effect. A macro to restart lumen to go back to normal Those 6 macros should make testing easier.
- [ ] **FPS counter** - Report actual achieved frame rate
- [ ] **Performance profiling** - Identify slow effects or bottlenecks

## 🎮 v1.6.0 - Fun Features

### PONG Mode
- [ ] **LED Pong game** - Printer plays during long prints!
  - Use position_x for paddle control
  - Use postion_y for cross "board" postion tracking and "scoring" calculation. Will need to read the printer.cfg for x and y size to determine LED index to display at which coord. Will need some thought to come up with proper method.
  - Ball bounces off "walls" (LED ends)
  - Score tracking via progress bar injection for scoring events and to show winner then end injection and continue progress bar.
  - Winner to be shown at 99% complete

## 🚫 Non-Goals (Won't Implement)

- **RGB color mixing in config** - Use named colors or extend color.py
- **Per-LED config in lumen.cfg** - Use `index_start`/`index_end` groups instead
- **Windows/macOS support** - Raspberry Pi GPIO is Linux-only
- **Standalone mode without Moonraker** - LUMEN is a Moonraker component by design
- **GUI configuration tool** - Editing lumen.cfg is intentionally simple

---

## 📅 Release Cycle

- **Patch releases (v1.0.x)**: Bug fixes only, no new features
- **Minor releases (v1.x.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Major releases (v2.0.0+)**: Breaking changes (config format, API changes)

**Current stable:** v1.4.4 (December 2025)
**In development:** v1.5.0 (Quality of Life)
**Next planned release:** v1.5.0 (Quality of Life) - Q1 2026

## 📝 Ideas Parking Lot

Random ideas not yet prioritized:

- Adaptive brightness based on time of day
- Sunrise/sunset effect (gradual warm color fade)
- Integration with Home Assistant (publish state via MQTT)
- LED strip health monitoring (detect dead LEDs, report via API)
- Custom user effects via Python plugins
- Multi-zone thermal gradients (bed left/right, extruder zones)
- Print time remaining estimation (via progress effect labels)

**Last Updated:** December 26, 2025
**Current Version:** v1.4.8 (beta - macro tracking investigation)
**Status:** ⚠️ v1.4.8 INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - Discovered that fully automatic macro detection is impossible for silent macros (G28, etc.). "Loud" macros (Z_TILT_ADJUST, BED_MESH_CALIBRATE) auto-detect via gcode responses. Silent macros require RESPOND messages. LUMEN_WAKE command planned for v1.5.0 to simplify integration.
